Problem 1- Three uncharged capacitors and an ideal battery are combined to
form the circuit shown to the right. Switch S1 is a simple open/closed switch,
while switch S2 can be toggled between poles a and b. The values for the
various circuit elements are as follows:
ΔVB = 24 V  C1 = 6.0 µF  C2 = 2.0 µF  C3 = 4.0 µF
C2 and C3 are parallel
C1 and C23 are serial
C1 is connected +
C23 is connected -

Switch S2 is closed, as shown, and the circuit is allowed to reach equilibrium.
(a) Find the charges on all three capacitors when the circuit is in equilibrium.

(b) How much work does the battery do while the array is reaching equilibrium? How much
potential energy is stored in the capacitor array?

First switch S1 is opened, and then switch S2 is thrown to pole b, as shown below. The circuit is again allowed to reach equilibrium.

(c) Find the charges on all three capacitors when the circuit has reached its new equilibrium.

(d) How much potential energy is now stored in the capacitor array

## 🧮 주어진 정보:

* 전압: ΔVB = 24 V
* C₁ = 6.0 µF
* C₂ = 2.0 µF
* C₃ = 4.0 µF
* C₂와 C₃는 병렬 (→ C₂₃)
* C₁과 C₂₃는 직렬
* C₁: +극 연결
* C₂₃: -극 연결
* 초기에는 모두 충전되지 않음

### ✅ After switches are changed:

* **S1 is open** (battery disconnected)
* **S2 is thrown to pole b**
* The three capacitors **C1 = 6.0 µF**, **C2 = 2.0 µF**, and **C3 = 4.0 µF** are now connected in **closed loop**, isolated from the battery.
* **Total charge remains conserved** because no external source/sink is connected.
* **Initial total charge** (from part a):
