Here is your full explanation and solution rewritten clearly in **English**:

### ✅ **Problem 1 (Original Configuration)**

**Three uncharged capacitors** and an **ideal battery** are connected as shown.

* **Battery voltage**: ΔV<sub>B</sub> = 24 V
* **Capacitors**:
  C₁ = 6.0 μF
  C₂ = 2.0 μF
  C₃ = 4.0 μF
* **Switches**:

  * S1: ON/OFF switch
  * S2: toggles between positions *a* and *b*
* Configuration:

  * C₂ and C₃ are in **parallel**
  * Their combination (C₂||C₃) is in **series** with C₁
  * C₁ is connected to the **+ terminal** of the battery
  * C₂||C₃ is connected to the **− terminal**

### (a) **Find the charge on each capacitor in equilibrium (with S1 closed, S2 at a)**

1. **C₂ and C₃ in parallel**:

   $$
   C_{23} = C_2 + C_3 = 2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0\,\mu\text{F}
   $$
2. **Series combination** with C₁:

   $$
   C_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_{23}} \right)^{-1} = \left( \frac{1}{6.0} + \frac{1}{6.0} \right)^{-1} = 3.0\,\mu\text{F}
   $$
3. **Total charge**:

   $$
   Q = C_{\text{eq}} \cdot V = 3.0 \cdot 24 = \boxed{72\,\mu\text{C}}
   $$
4. **C₁ (in series)** gets the full charge:

   $$
   Q_1 = \boxed{72\,\mu\text{C}}
   $$
5. **C₂ and C₃ (parallel)** share 72 μC with same voltage (12 V):

   $$
   Q_2 = C_2 \cdot 12 = \boxed{24\,\mu\text{C}},\quad Q_3 = C_3 \cdot 12 = \boxed{48\,\mu\text{C}}
   $$

### (b) **How much work does the battery do? How much energy is stored?**

* **Work done by battery**:

  $$
  W = Q \cdot V = 72 \cdot 24 = \boxed{1728\,\mu\text{J}}
  $$
* **Stored energy in capacitors**:

  $$
  U = \frac{1}{2} C_{\text{eq}} V^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3.0 \cdot 24^2 = \boxed{864\,\mu\text{J}}
  $$

> ⚠️ Note: Half the energy is **lost** (e.g., as heat) during the charging process. This is expected in capacitor charging.

### ⚙️ **Modified Configuration**

After reaching initial equilibrium:

* **Switch S1 is opened** → Battery is disconnected
* **Switch S2 is flipped to position b**
* Now: C₁, C₂, C₃ form a **closed loop with no battery**

---

### (c) **Find the charges on all capacitors in new equilibrium (battery disconnected)**

Now the capacitors are **connected in series loop**, forming a closed circuit.

In a series circuit:

* **Charge on all capacitors must be equal**:

  $$
  Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3 = \boxed{48\,\mu\text{C}}
  $$

---

### (d) **How much potential energy is now stored in the capacitor array?**

Stored energy:

$$
U = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{Q^2}{C_1} + \frac{Q^2}{C_2} + \frac{Q^2}{C_3} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{48^2}{6} + \frac{48^2}{2} + \frac{48^2}{4} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} (384 + 1152 + 576)
= \boxed{1056\,\mu\text{J}}
$$

### ❓ Key Insights

* In a **series** connection, **charge is always equal** across all capacitors — regardless of different capacitances.
* Capacitors can be safely connected in loop even if their original polarities were different — charges redistribute naturally.
* **Total charge is conserved**, but **energy is not** — some energy is always lost (usually as heat) when charge redistributes without a source.
